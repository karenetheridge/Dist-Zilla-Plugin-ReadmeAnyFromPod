0.142180  2014-08-05 20:55:45-07:00 America/Vancouver (TRIAL RELEASE)   - UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE
    - add "phase" option, for the ability to generate the README file at

    - Eliminate implicit dependency on specific version of Path::Class
    - Minor documentation updates

0.141120  2014-04-22 15:35:30 America/Los_Angeles
    - Adjust tests for change in Pod::Markdown output

0.133360  2013-12-02 01:09:18 America/Los_Angeles
    - Require the appropriate version of Path::Tiny

0.133290  2013-11-24 22:12:39 America/Los_Angeles
    - First real release compatible with dzil v5

0.133060  2013-11-02 16:56:50 America/Los_Angeles
    - Add a test for non-utf8 encoded input.

0.133030  2013-10-30 00:53:24 America/Los_Angeles
    - Require Pod::Simple version 3.23 for parse_characters

0.133000  2013-10-27 14:12:47 America/Los_Angeles
    - Fix handling of case where readme contents are regenerated after the
      source .pm is altered after we initially looked at it

0.132970  2013-10-24 12:11:46 America/Los_Angeles
    - Module now works with both Dist::Zilla version 5.X and up (which
      hanldes file encodings) and Dist::Zilla version 4.X and below
      (with no special handling of file encodings at all). This is a
      potential regression for users of Dist::Zilla 4.X, since
      previously this module made some poor attempts at handling
      encoding. If you need correct handling of file encodings, you
      should upgrade Dist::Zilla to version 5.

0.132973  2013-10-23 17:15:29 America/Los_Angeles
    - now using FileGatherer, FileMunger and AfterBuild phases rather than
      InstallerTool

0.132962  2013-10-23 15:45:36 America/Los_Angeles
    - Now compatible *only* with Dist::Zilla version 5 and up
    - Add test for excluding root README files from build

0.131500  2013-05-30 02:03:44 America/Los_Angeles

    - Added more tests

0.120053  2012-01-05 13:42:35 PST8PDT
    - Option autodetection now works better. In particular, it now

0.120052  2012-01-05 11:07:05 PST8PDT
    - Added a test to make sure \r characters never appear in any
      output.

0.120051  2012-01-04 23:42:29 PST8PDT
    - Prevent perl from adding \r characters on win32 by writing files
      in binmode. This ensures that the same output is produced on all
      platforms. (contributed by MITHALDU)

    - Added the ability to sepcify file name and format. Support for
