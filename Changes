Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-ReadmeAnyFromPod

{{$NEXT}}
    - fix handling of case where readme contents are regenerated after the
      source .pm is altered after we initially looked at it

0.132970  2013-10-24 12:11:46 America/Los_Angeles
    - Module now works with both Dist::Zilla version 5.X and up (which
      hanldes file encodings) and Dist::Zilla version 4.X and below
      (with no special handling of file encodings at all). This is a
      potential regression for users of Dist::Zilla 4.X, since
      previously this module made some poor attempts at handling
      encoding. If you need correct handling of file encodings, you
      should upgrade Dist::Zilla to version 5.

0.132973  2013-10-23 17:15:29 America/Los_Angeles
    - now using FileGatherer, FileMunger and AfterBuild phases rather than
      InstallerTool

0.132962  2013-10-23 15:45:36 America/Los_Angeles
    - Now compatible *only* with Dist::Zilla version 5 and up
    - Add test for excluding root README files from build

0.131500  2013-05-30 02:03:44 America/Los_Angeles
    - Allow source POD to come from somewhere other than the main
      module (contributed by Hercynium)

0.120120  2012-01-11 22:41:25 PST8PDT
    - Slight improvement to log messages for file overrides
    - Added more tests

0.120053  2012-01-05 13:42:35 PST8PDT
    - Option autodetection now works better. In particular, it now
      works when the plugin is used as part of a bundle.

0.120052  2012-01-05 11:07:05 PST8PDT
    - Added a test to make sure \r characters never appear in any
      output.

0.120051  2012-01-04 23:42:29 PST8PDT
    - Prevent perl from adding \r characters on win32 by writing files
      in binmode. This ensures that the same output is produced on all
      platforms. (contributed by MITHALDU)
    - Prevent modules in corpus directory from being indexed.

0.120040  2012-01-04 11:12:47 PST8PDT
    - Now supports parsing options from given plugin name
    - Added tests, which should all pass

0.103522  2010-12-18 12:44:44 EST5EDT
    - Updated abstract to be more descriptive

0.103521  2010-12-18 00:01:23 EST5EDT
    - Added html format

    - Prune files with location = root, so they don't sneak back into
      the dist via GatherDir.

0.103520  2010-12-17 22:51:34 EST5EDT
    - Added the ability to sepcify file name and format. Support for
      three formats included: plaintext, markdown, and pod.
    - Initial release after forking from ReadmeFromPod. This module
      remains backward-compatible.
